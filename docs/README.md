# Axios DSL Documentation

The documentation set is organised to serve distinct audiences ranging from new practitioners to contributors extending the runtime. All content is written in English and aligns with the specification defined in the Axios DSL Manual.

## Directory Overview

- `book/` — Comprehensive manual covering philosophy, grammar, semantics, runtime architecture, tooling, and appendices.
- `guide/` — Task-oriented walkthroughs for onboarding, daily operation, and roadmap planning.
- `language/` — Conceptual overview of language constructs, type considerations, and emerging features.
- `architecture/` — Internal design notes describing intermediate representations, planning strategies, and executor components.
- `reference/` — Command-line reference, artifact data models, and SDK guidance.

## Suggested Reading Sequence

1. Begin with the [Preface](book/preface.md) and [Design Philosophy](book/philosophy.md) to understand the intent of the language.
2. Study the [Language Fundamentals](book/fundamentals.md) to learn the core directives and execution model.
3. Follow the operational guidance in the [Getting Started Guide](guide/first-run.md).
4. Consult the [Reference](reference/README.md) whenever you need authoritative command or schema details.
5. Review [Architecture Notes](architecture/README.md) when contributing to the runtime or executor internals.

## Living Documents

- Architectural decisions and RFCs are catalogued under `architecture/` as the project evolves.
- The roadmap in `guide/roadmap.md` is updated to reflect upcoming milestones and planned integrations.
- Schema definitions and SDK recommendations under `reference/` are versioned to stay aligned with artifact changes.

Feedback, errata, and contributions are welcome through the project issue tracker and pull requests. Please reference relevant documentation sections when proposing updates to maintain traceability.
