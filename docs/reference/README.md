# Reference Index

The reference section provides authoritative details for implementers and integrators.

- [CLI and Runtime Data Model](data-model.md) — Describes execution reports, artifact structures, and CLI output formats.
- [SDK Overview](sdk.md) — Summarises planned client libraries and integration patterns.
- `schemas/` — Houses machine-readable JSON Schemas for artifacts and future API payloads.

Additional references (capabilities, metrics, CLI command catalogue) will be published as features stabilise.
