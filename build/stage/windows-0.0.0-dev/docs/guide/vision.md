# Vision for Axios DSL

Axios DSL aims to make offensive security playbooks as reproducible and auditable as infrastructure-as-code. The project envisions a language and runtime that allow practitioners to encode reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting workflows with the same discipline applied to deployment pipelines.

## Strategic Objectives

- **Codified methodology**: Preserve institutional knowledge by representing engagements as shareable, version-controlled scenarios rather than ad hoc scripts and notes.
- **Interoperability**: Align with industry standards such as MITRE ATT&CK, coreLang, SARIF, CycloneDX SBOM, and Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) to streamline data exchange.
- **Runtime transparency**: Provide deterministic execution, structured logging, and explicit artifact retention to satisfy legal, compliance, and audit requirements.
- **Extensible ecosystem**: Support modules, SDKs, and third-party integrations so that Axios becomes a unifying layer across security tooling.

## Medium-Term Capabilities

1. **Scenario intelligence** — Context-aware scans that adapt based on earlier findings while preserving reproducibility guarantees.
2. **Threat modelling as code** — Native representations of attack graphs with mappings to ATT&CK techniques and defensive controls.
3. **DevSecOps integration** — Seamless export to SARIF and SBOM formats; CI/CD guardrails that leverage Axios outputs for policy enforcement.
4. **Operations centre alignment** — Enrichment pipelines and dashboards enabling SOC analysts to correlate Axios findings with telemetry.

## Long-Term Ambition

The project aspires to become the lingua franca for repeatable offensive security exercises. By treating scenarios as first-class artifacts, organisations can bridge gaps between assessment teams, defenders, and engineering stakeholders, enabling faster remediation and informed risk decisions.
