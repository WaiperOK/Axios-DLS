# Guide Index

The guides provide task-focused instructions for adopting Axios DSL in day-to-day operations. They complement the formal specification in `docs/book/` by emphasising practical workflows, operator checklists, and forward-looking plans.

- [First Run](first-run.md) — Install the toolchain, execute the introductory scenario, and inspect artifacts.
- [Hello World Scenario](hello-world.md) — Build a minimal scenario from scratch and understand each directive.
- [Pentest Toolkit](pentest-toolkit.md) — Assemble a reusable module for offensive security engagements.
- [Vision and Principles](vision.md) — Contextualise the project goals and long-term aspirations.
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md) — Track upcoming milestones and engineering priorities.
- [Backlog](todo.md) — Curated list of enhancement candidates and research topics.

All guides adopt a serious, technical tone suitable for engineering handbooks. Contributions should include reproducible commands, explicit prerequisites, and references to the relevant sections of the manual.
