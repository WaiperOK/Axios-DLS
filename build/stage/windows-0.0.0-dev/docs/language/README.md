# Language Overview

The language documentation explores Axios DSL from a conceptual perspective. Use it alongside the formal specification in `docs/book/` to gain intuition about modelling techniques, emerging features, and ongoing research directions.

- [Conceptual Overview](overview.md) — Introduces the scenario model, directive taxonomy, and compositional patterns.
- [Specification Notes](spec.md) — Highlights normative rules, reserved keywords, and evolution guidelines.
- [Type Considerations](types.md) — Discusses implicit typing, validation strategies, and future extensions toward richer type systems.

Additional topics such as conditional execution, inline functions, and annotations will be documented as the language evolves.
